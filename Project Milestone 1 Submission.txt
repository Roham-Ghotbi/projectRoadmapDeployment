Part 1: Project Proposal

- Who are you? Tell us about your team & skills. If there are key focus areas each of you is spearheading, help us know!

I actually don’t have a team.

I’m an 4th year EECS student and I have considerable python programming experience. I’m most interested in building an efficient backend and developing intuitive UX.

- What are you building?

Side Project Roadmap is a goal setting and timeline visualization webapp for side projects. Without the formal structure of a course, clients or company it can be difficult to maintain momentum on a personal side project. It is a visual timeline for people who are passionate about making or learning through making. Its main aims are to aid in visualization and increase social accountability.

- Who are you building it for?  Why did you choose this area?

The target user group is people who are serious about their side projects and want a way to organize and keep themselves accountable for the deadlines they set themselves. Primarily people ages 20-30 who are already fairly adept with technology and familiar with using other webapps. I chose this area because I’m someone who often loses momentum when working on a side project, so I see the need for this app. In addition such a tool does not yet exist. The closest solution that currently exists is Roadmap, which is a visual project and team management app. The purpose of this app is to target people who are passionate about their side projects, so it differs from a team management perspective, which will significantly influence the design and features of the app.

- What are the indicators of success for your project? example: a cleaner, more intuitive interface than the existing solution, etc.

It should be something that people can use easily. Its goal is to offload the mental labor of keep track of progress and goals on a side project in a visually pleasing and intuitive manner such that it is a pleasure to use. I visualize it as something visually light, simple to use and understand, highly functional, with intuitive and efficient user interactions. 

Part 2: Web Framework

-Which web framework did you choose for your project and why

I’m going with Flask because of the course support for it.

-How does it fit in with your project goals and architecture

My main concern for the framework is simplicity and efficiency, and I believe that Flask supports this.

-What has your experience been so far with the framework

I’ve had minimal exposure before this class, but I feel fairly confident about the experiences gained during this class.

Part 3: Information Architecture

-What are some key user personas of your application and what are the information needs of these users interacting with your system

A user needs to be able to create projects that have actions associated with them, organized into chains of actions. A user should be able to set dates they want to arrive at the actions by and visualize these chains of actions (including those of their other projects) in differing granularities.

-What entities or objects are you storing in the application. How do these map to your user's information needs

User: Entity that owns and updates projects. A user should be able to share and see friend’s projects and progress and visualize along with their own projects.
Project: Comprised of one or multiple chains of actions. There is an overall goal date for the project.
Chains of Actions: Groups of actions that get the user closer to their goal.
Actions: The smallest unit of our system. Has a date and description attached to it.

-How do these entities interact with each other - Which model did you choose(Relational, non-relational and Hybrid)

I think I covered the way these entities interact with each other in the question above I chose a relational db because the data that will be collected is rigidly defined. In addition, SQL data integrity is crucial for this system.
